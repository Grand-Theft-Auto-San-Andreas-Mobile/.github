<h2>Quick Review of GTA San Andreas</h2>
<p>GTA: SA (also widely known as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas) is a popular and highly successful action, third-person shooter, driving, and RPG game by Rockstar Games and Rockstar North. It is the seventh gaming title in the Grand Theft Auto series.</p>
<p>Similar to the gameplay structure followed by the previous Grand Theft Auto series, this game also provides an interactive third-person view, giving you complete control over how you want to interact with the open-world game environment. You can freely roam around the areas, explore shops and restaurants, steal cars and bikes from the streets, cause destruction to property, and attack pedestrians.</p>
<p>This life-like game mainly consists of three cities, i.e., Las Venturas, Los Santos, and San Fierro. Within those cities, your character can walk, jump, swim, and run. It can use various destructive weapons, drive different kinds of vehicles, fly helicopters, ride motorcycles, boats, trains, and even destructive tanks. Apart from stealing cars from the citizens, you can even import exclusive vehicles and customize them (by adding nitrous) to make them more powerful.</p>
<figure><img src="https://bestforandroid.com/apk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GTA-San-Andreas-apk-gameplay-900x506.jpg" alt="GTA San Andreas mod apk gameplay Android" width="900" height="506" data-src="https://bestforandroid.com/apk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GTA-San-Andreas-apk-gameplay-900x506.jpg" data-eio-rwidth="900" data-eio-rheight="506" /></figure>
<p>To give the in-game world a realistic touch, all locations include vast regions of forests, deserts, beautiful landscapes, hilly areas, ponds, and mountains. There are some restricted areas, too. You can play and move your character around to explore the in-game world.</p>
<p>GTA San Andreas is the first game to offer remarkable capabilities for customizing the appearance of the in-game character. To this end, there are clothing stores with accessories, tattoo shops, hair salons, restaurants, and even a gym. If you force your character to eat a lot of food, he will become fat. Then, you must take him to the gym for workouts and training to make him muscular and stay healthy.</p>
<p>If you like the GTA San Andreas game app, you may also want to check out the latest&nbsp;Grand Theft Auto 5 for Android&nbsp;apk.</p>
<p>Now you know there is much to achieve and accomplish within the game. Apart from those usual storyline missions that are compulsory to complete to unlock certain content and areas, you are allowed to take part in small and exciting side missions to earn some extra in-game money like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paramedics where injured people must be picked up from nearby areas and driven to the hospital.</li>
<li>Burglary is when you break into a citizen&rsquo;s home during the hours of darkness and steal expensive items like a television without being caught by the police.</li>
<li>Taxicab, where you work as a taxi driver to pick up and drop off passengers.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can then spend all that earned money at various extents, including shopping, food, car modifications, physical appearance, importing vehicles, gambling, and other aspects.</p>
<p>If you are running low on money or want to get vehicles without importing them, you can use hacks and cheats like&nbsp;CLEO mods scripts&nbsp;with GTA San Andreas. The cheat menu is what makes it the perfect hack for GTA SA. :D</p>
<h3>GTA SA Storyline</h3>
<p>The GTA SA storyline includes the main character, Carl Johnson (CJ), who returns home to Los Santos during the early 1990s. At this point, his mother has been murdered, and he finds that his whole family has fallen apart and old childhood friends are ruining their lives by heading towards unlawful activities. In contrast, the whole city is captured by cruel gang members, and people are involved in corruption and drugs.</p>
<p>To find the truth behind his mother&rsquo;s murder and save his family members, he goes all the way to rebuild his old street gang (Groove Street Families), clashes with the corrupt cops, and regains control over the streets of Los Santos and surrounding areas by taking part in gang warfare where he takes over the enemy territories. He also reduced the amount of drugs being used within the region. Doing all of these helped CJ gain much respect among his friends and the neighborhood residents.</p>
<p>The GTA San Andreas Android version has a gameplay structure and missions almost identical to the original PC version. Still, developers have added several upgrades and enhancements to polish the game for mobile devices. They also added a much superior draw distance, detailed and dynamic shadows, an enriched color palette, and improvements in car models and characters to make the game more optimized for Android phones and tablet devices.</p>

<h3>Features &amp; Notable Improvements in the Game</h3>
<p>With the release of the GTA San Andreas app and the full version data for Android, the developers behind the Rockstar Games integrated numerous additional features to enhance the overall gameplay, particularly for Android mobile devices.</p>
<p>Some of the notable improvements and features are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Improvements:</strong>&nbsp;If you have played the previous version of this series, then you must have noticed that the player cannot swim and used to get drowned. However, with the latest release, Rockstar Games has allowed the player to explore the sea through swimming and various boats, as well as the ability to complete marine-based missions. All of this adds greater depth to the game.</li>
<li><strong>Huge Collection of Vehicles:</strong>&nbsp;The game has a really big collection of cars and vehicles from almost every category and type, including SUVs and pickup trucks, sports cars, vans, industrial and heavy vehicles, lowriders, motorcycles, bikes, aircraft, hatchbacks, trains, sedans, boats, and a lot more. You can unlock some vehicles and a few through special missions, or some are hidden in special places within the map. The jetpack is one of the most notable ones that can be used for transportation.</li>
<li><strong>Modify and Customize Cars:</strong>&nbsp;The GTA SA has a whopping collection of two hundred and twelve vehicles, although these are divided into various categories and types. However, some of them are sports cars while others are regular ones, but the game offers the option to customize aspects and features of the car like bumpers, side skirts, rims, body kits, custom paint, nitrous, hydraulics, and whatnot.</li>
<li><strong>Crime and Robbery:</strong>&nbsp;This is one of the most sought-after missions included in this game. We can also call it a mini-mission, where you are allowed to gain access to the residents' homes and rob their valuables&mdash;silently, without making any noise. You can then later sell those for a profit. It is one of the key sources of generating some quick bucks in the game, which can ultimately help you buy weapons, new clothes, and even some food for yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Spending Money:</strong>&nbsp;As we were talking about making in-game money, which is the feature that has been added to the game from the previous few releases, the only thing we were able to buy was the properties. But with the release of San Andreas, you can feed your character with some food and drinks, get haircuts and tattoos, buy suits, spend on the casino, and get weapons and body armor for the missions and tasks that require you to be equipped with better ammo and arms to be able to take out the opponents quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Unmatched HD Graphics Quality:</strong>&nbsp;The Android version of GTA San Andreas provides superior-quality graphics and great resolution, even on mobile and tablet devices. The developers have said to use a fictionalized version of the environments and landmarks taken from the original cities as well as U.S.-based states.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Gameplay Saving Capability:</strong>&nbsp;With this new capability, you can save the game onto the cloud storage within the network, which is then accessible from any of your connected devices, including PC, Android, iOS, and other devices. There is also an auto-saving option that can automatically save your current game progress right into the selected autosave spot. To be able to enjoy the cloud-saving option, it is important that you just need to have a Rockstar Social Club membership.</li>
<li><strong>Gang Wars and Territories:</strong>&nbsp;There is a new concept introduced in the game named Gang Warfare, or you can call it an added task that requires you to take over and capture an enemy gang&rsquo;s territory. Successfully doing this rewards you with money and respect. Moreover, the captured territories by the Groove Street Families are a lot more after to travel as compared to the ones occupied by Ballas and Los Santos Vagos. Gang wars can be triggered in two ways, i.e., by killing the opponents or when the opponent gang member tries to reclaim the territory.</li>
<li><strong>Support for External Devices:</strong>&nbsp;To make the gaming experience even more remarkable, the game has native support for several game controllers, including HUD-compliant USB controllers manufactured by the MOGA series and other Bluetooth-based controllers with analog sticks. Moreover, you can enjoy better control over your character using the on-screen touch control options.</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility and System Support:</strong>&nbsp;Apart from compatibility with controllers and Bluetooth-based gamepads, which can possibly improve your gameplay experience on mobile devices, system support also helps make the devices far more playable for the majority, as most devices these days are running at least Android 7.0 Nougat.</li>
<li><strong>Graphics Quality and Improvements:</strong>&nbsp;GTA San Andreas for Android brings various graphics settings and customizability that allow you to play the game on the highest settings if you have a device with heavy specs, or you may lower the graphics settings to have a lag-free gaming experience without compromising on the speeds.</li>
<li><strong>Huge Gameplay:</strong>&nbsp;With the open-world map, number of missions and tasks, and small money-based tasks, the total gameplay time of GTA SA is over seventy hours, provided that you are a pro at gaming and can complete all the tasks at a better completion rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because GTA San Andreas is a resource-hungry game and consumes a lot of RAM and storage space, it is recommended that you restart your device and close all the running apps before playing the game. This will ensure that the game performs well and doesn&rsquo;t cause any unwanted lags and delays.</p>
